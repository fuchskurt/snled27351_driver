//! Transport trait and concrete implementations for SNLED27351 bus
//! communication.
//!
//! The driver is generic over any type implementing [`Transport`], allowing
//! the same register logic to run over both SPI and I2C without duplication.
//! Select the appropriate transport for your hardware:
//!
//! - `spi::Controller` — wraps N
//!   [`SpiDevice`](embedded_hal_async::spi::SpiDevice)s (one per chip, each
//!   managing its own CS line) and one SDB pin.
//! - `i2c::Controller` — wraps an [`I2c`](embedded_hal_async::i2c::I2c) bus,
//!   one 7-bit address per chip, and an optional SDB pin (see [`NoSdb`]).
//!
//! When exactly one transport feature is enabled, its controller is also
//! re-exported as `transport::Controller` for convenience. When both features
//! are enabled (Cargo features are additive, so this can happen via feature
//! unification), refer to the controllers by their module paths
//! `transport::spi::Controller` and `transport::i2c::Controller`.
