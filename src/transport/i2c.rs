//! I2C transport implementation for the SNLED27351 driver.
//!
//! Uses [`I2c`] with one 7-bit device address per driver chip (see the
//! `ADDRESS_*` constants), plus an optional shared SDB pin (use
//! [`NoSdb`] if SDB is strapped high in hardware).
//!
//! # Framing
//!
//! The SNLED27351 treats every I2C write frame as `[register, data...]`,
//! so each register access is up to two bus frames:
//!
//! 1. A write to the command register (`0xFD`) selecting the active page.
//!    Skipped when the page is already selected — the transport caches the
//!    selected page per chip, as permitted by datasheet section 4.2.
//! 2. The register write (or a write-read for register reads).
//!
//! The page select must be its own STOP-terminated frame: it cannot be
//! combined with the following access inside one `transaction()`, because
//! [`I2c::transaction`] merges
//! adjacent write operations into a single frame — the chip would then see
//! `[0xFD, page, reg, data...]` and auto-increment the payload into the
//! wrong registers.
//!
//! Splitting into two frames is still race-free for this driver: it holds
//! `&mut` access to the bus (or bus device) for the whole call, and traffic
//! to other devices on a shared bus does not affect this chip's page state.
